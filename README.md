# Wigxel Vanilla JS **Mini Tasks**

This test is meant to help you through hints develop algorithms from
the following comments on any task document. From these comments
you'll have to thinking of the best way possible to complete the task
given to you.

Every task here requires basic knowledge of HTML & CSS, or atleast
some experience with Javascript fundamentals. If you don't have any of
those, then am afraid the test may be quite confusing.
